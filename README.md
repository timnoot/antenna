Welcome to the Satellite Tracker Antenna project! This project aims to develop an automated antenna system capable of tracking weather (NOAA) satellites and receiving high-quality images from space.

## Open-Source Kit for Students

One of our goals with this project is to make an open-source kit that students can build themselves. This kit will serve as an educational tool, allowing students to learn about satellite technology, engineering, and data processing through hands-on experience.

### Features

- **Automated Tracking**: The antenna system autonomously follows the satellite's trajectory.
- **High-Quality Images**: Capture and process images directly from NOAA satellites.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify and extend the system to suit different needs and preferences.

## Project Highlights

Here's a preview of what our project has achieved so far:
